Most Mystics are generally good and decent
folk, interested in aiding those in need and
defending the weak from danger. Some
Mystics, however, ally with evil forces,
making them terrifying enemies. A few
follow spiritual paths guiding them to
self-interest, more than willing to sell their
services as mercenaries.
Combining raw power with subtle
manipulations, Mystics excel in supporting
their teammates. A Mysticâ€™s ability to call
upon spiritual connections for guidance
often helps weight the dice to their favor.
