{"name":"cyberhound","description":"Cyber hounds were a wildly successful attempt to graft cybernetics on animals. The hounds retain the loyalty typical to dogs and possess a number of enhancements, such as infrared sensors, steel jaws, cybernetic legs, and a reinforced exoskeleton, that grant them durability, speed, and night vision, as well as a powerful bite. Some cyber hounds come with communication devices used to alert their owners when an intrusion occurs. Due to their capabilities and the cost to add cybernetics to a dog, they are quite expensive.","attributes":{"Agility":{"name":"Agility","die":8,"mod":0},"Smarts":{"name":"Smarts","die":6,"mod":0},"Spirit":{"name":"Spirit","die":8,"mod":0},"Strength":{"name":"Strength","die":8,"mod":0},"Vigor":{"name":"Vigor","die":10,"mod":0}},"skills":{"Athletics":{"name":"Athletics","die":8,"mod":0},"Fighting":{"name":"Fighting","die":8,"mod":0},"Notice":{"name":"Notice","die":10,"mod":0}},"pace":8,"parry":6,"toughness":{"value":9,"armor":2},"hindrances":{"–":{"name":"–","major":false,"note":""}},"edges":["Alertness","Fleet-Footed"],"gear":{},"special_abilities":{}}
