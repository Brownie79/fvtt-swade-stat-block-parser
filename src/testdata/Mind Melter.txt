When a leader or faction wants the most
powerful psionic capabilities available,
the Mind Melter is the specialist of choice.
There are none stronger in matters of the
mind, and Mind Melters are equally useful
in overt combat situations and covert
infiltration and information-gathering
operations. Of course, they are also masters
of psychological warfare.
Mind Melters can demand extraordinary
wages for all of the reasons above, and
also because they are without question
the best asset a unit can have in counterpsionic warfare.
