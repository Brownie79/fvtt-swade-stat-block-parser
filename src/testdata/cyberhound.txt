Cyber hounds were a wildly successful attempt to graft cybernetics on animals. The hounds retain the loyalty typical to dogs and possess a number of enhancements, such as infrared sensors, steel jaws, cybernetic legs, and a reinforced exoskeleton, that grant them durability, speed, and night vision, as well as a powerful bite. Some cyber hounds come with communication devices used to alert their owners when an intrusion occurs. Due to their capabilities and the cost to add cybernetics to a dog, they are quite expensive.
